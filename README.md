# ShapeScape
A generative art application written in Java using the Processing library. Generates a background with randomly placed shapes in the foreground.

# Running the program
After downloading the sourcecode, you will need to set up Processing to run ShapeScape.
* Download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) 
* In Processing you need to install processing-java which can be found in the Tools tab.
* Install the controlP5 library from `Sketch > Import Library > Add Library` (last known working version 2.2.6)

Once processing-java and the libraries are installed, you're ready to run ShapeScape!
